title: Brand Renamed From Master

Brand renamed from `master` to `main`

```shell
git branch -m master main
``` 

Let's quickly check if this has worked as expected:

```shell
git status
```

Make sure your current local HEAD branch is still "main" when executing the following command:

```shell
git push -u origin main
```

We now have a new branch on the remote named "main". Let's go on and remove the old "master" branch on the remote:

```shell
git push origin --delete master
```
