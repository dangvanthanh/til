title: Composables as State Management in Vue
tags: [javascript, vue]
---

In some scenenarios, shared state between instances is desired. This can be archived by declaring the state outside the composable function.

```javascript
import { ref } from 'vue'

// state declared here will be shared
const shareState = ref()

export function useComposable() {
  // state declared here will NOT be shared
  // and will be initialized every time
  const localState = ref()

  // Setters and getters for both
  // can be defined here
  
  return {
    sharedState,
    localState
  }
}
```
