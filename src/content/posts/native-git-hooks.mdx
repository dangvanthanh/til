First, create the `.hooks` folder in your project. Add the `pre-commit` file and grant it executable permission with `chmod +x .hooks/pre-commit`

```shell
#!/bin/sh
echo "pre-commit hook run"
```

Now, let's open the `package.json` file and add the following line to scripts.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "prepare": "git config core.hooksPath .hooks",
  }
}
```

Now you can run install for running prepare scripts.
