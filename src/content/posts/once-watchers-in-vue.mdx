Watcher's callback will execute whenever the watched source changes. If you want the callback to trigger only once when the source changes, use the `once: true` option.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const source = ref('')

watch(source, (newValue, oldValue) => {
  // when `source` changes, triggers only once
}, { once: true})
</script>
```
