In develop a single-page application in Vue.js, the browser doesn't make a request to the server on every URL change. The browser only makes a request to server for the **initial page load** and when the URL change (example [http://yoursite.com](http://yoursite.com) to [http://yoursite.com/about](http://yoursite.com/about)) it's up to **Vue** to determine what content should be displayed.

## The router instance

````js
import App from 'App.vue';
import router from './router/';

const app = new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  // introduction the router instance
  router: router,
  render: h => h(App)
});```

The router instance is created by using the Vue Router constructor and passing in an object that contains the key/value pairs for the path and component that should render for that particular path.

```js
import Home from 'Home.vue';
import About from 'About.vue';

const router = new Router({
  routes: [
    {
      path: '/',
      component: Home
    },
    {
      path: '/about',
      component: About
    }
  ]
});
````

## router-view

The `router-view` component renders a specified component based on the app's location as dictated in the router instance.

```js
<div id="app">
  <router-view />
</div>
```

## router-link

The `router-link` component allows the users change the location of the browser without reloading the browser.

```js
<div id="app">
  <router-view />
  <router-link to="/about">About</router-link>
</div>
```
